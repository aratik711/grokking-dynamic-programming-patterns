"""

Given a number sequence, find the increasing subsequence with the highest sum. Write a method that returns the highest sum.

Example 1:

Input: {4,1,2,6,10,1,12}
Output: 32
Explanation: The increaseing sequence is {4,6,10,12}.
Please note the difference, as the LIS is {1,2,6,10,12} which has a sum of '31'.
Example 2:

Input: {-4,10,3,7,15}
Output: 25
Explanation: The increaseing sequences are {10, 15} and {3,7,15}.

The time complexity of the above algorithm is exponential O(2^n)
, where ānā is the lengths of the input array. The space complexity is O(n)
 which is used to store the recursion stack.
