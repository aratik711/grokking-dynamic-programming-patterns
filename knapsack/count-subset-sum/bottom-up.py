Given a set of positive numbers, find the total number of subsets whose sum is equal to a given number āSā.

Example 1:#
Input: {1, 1, 2, 3}, S=4
Output: 3
The given set has '3' subsets whose sum is '4': {1, 1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 3}
Note that we have two similar sets {1, 3}, because we have two '1' in our input.
Example 2:#
Input: {1, 2, 7, 1, 5}, S=9
Output: 3
The given set has '3' subsets whose sum is '9': {2, 7}, {1, 7, 1}, {1, 2, 1, 5}

The time complexity of the above algorithm is exponential O(2^n), where ānā represents the total number. The space complexity is O(n)
, this memory is used to store the recursion stack.
