Given a staircase with ānā steps and an array of ānā numbers representing the fee that you have to pay if you take the step. Implement a method to calculate the minimum fee required to reach the top of the staircase (beyond the top-most step). At every step, you have an option to take either 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps. You should assume that you are standing at the first step.

Example 1:

Number of stairs (n) : 6
Fee: {1,2,5,2,1,2}
Output: 3
Explanation: Starting from index '0', we can reach the top through: 0->3->top
The total fee we have to pay will be (1+2).
Example 2:

Number of stairs (n): 4
Fee: {2,3,4,5}
Output: 5
Explanation: Starting from index '0', we can reach the top through: 0->1->top
The total fee we have to pay will be (2+3).

The time complexity of the above algorithm is exponential O(3^n)
. The space complexity is O(n) which is used to store the recursion stack.
