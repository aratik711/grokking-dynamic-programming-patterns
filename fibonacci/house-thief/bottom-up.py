"""

Given a number array representing the wealth of n houses, determine the maximum amount of money the thief can steal without alerting the security system.

Example 1:

Input: {2, 5, 1, 3, 6, 2, 4}
Output: 15
Explanation: The thief should steal from houses 5 + 6 + 4
Example 2:

Input: {2, 10, 14, 8, 1}
Output: 18
Explanation: The thief should steal from houses 10 + 8

The only restriction the thief has is that he canâ€™t steal from two consecutive houses, as that would alert the security system. How should the thief maximize his stealing?
